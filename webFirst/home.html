<h2>About Mongolia</h2>
<p>Mongolia is a landlocked country in East Asia, bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south. It covers an area of 1,564,116 square kilometres
     (603,909 square miles), with a population of just 3.3 million, making it the world's most sparsely populated sovereign nation. Mongolia is the world's
      largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea, and much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and
       the Gobi Desert to the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to roughly half of the country's population.

    The territory of modern-day Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Rouran, the First Turkic Khaganate,
     and others. In 1206, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous land empire in history. His grandson Kublai Khan 
     conquered China proper and established the Yuan dynasty. After the collapse of the Yuan, the Mongols retreated to Mongolia and resumed their earlier
      pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of Dayan Khan and Tumen Zasagt Khan. In the 16th century, Tibetan Buddhism spread to Mongolia, 
      being further led by the Manchu-founded Qing dynasty, which absorbed the country in the 17th century. By the early 20th century, almost one-third of 
      the adult male population were Buddhist monks.[11][12] After the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia declared independence, and achieved actual
       independence from the Republic of China in 1921. Shortly thereafter, the country became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, which had aided its 
       independence from China. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was founded as a socialist state.[13] After the anti-communist revolutions of 1989, 
       Mongolia conducted its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990. This led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition
        to a market economy. </p>

<h2>Administrative divisions</h2>
<p>Mongolia is divided into 21 provinces (aimags) and subdivided into 331 districts (sums). The capital Ulaanbaatar is administrated separately as a 
    capital city (municipality) with provincial status. The aimags are:</p>
