                <h3>Best Places To Visit In Mongolia</h3>

                    this country welcomes you to enjoy the exciting silence of nature. Founded by Genghis Khan, Mongolia is a country with varying historic 
                    backgrounds and the influence of surrounding neighbors. The rugged landscape of the country inhabits a huge number of animals and a unique 
                    flora. You will not be sorry to visit this country. Let's begin our quest to some of the spectacular as well as popular places to visit in 
                    Mongolia.</p>

                <h3>Best Time To Visit Mongolia</h3>
                <p>In spring, the weather can be pretty harsh with strong winds and still cold temperatures. In June, summer is approaching and the temperature is 
                    between 20 and 30 degrees celsius. It still can be a bit chilly in the night but nothing compared to autumn. Because of the rain, the landscape is
                     nice and green. If you want to visit the Gobi desert then come in May or September when it is not so hot. Winters are bitter cold but with the right
                      equipment, there is also a lot to do in the Mongolian Winter.</p></p>

                <h3>Best Food To Eat In Mongolia</h3>
                <p>The most common rural dish is cooked mutton, usually without any other ingredients. To accompany the meats, vegetables and flour 
                    products may be used to create side dishes as well. In the city, every other local displays a sign saying "buuz". Those are steamed 
                    dumplings filled with meat. Other types of dumplings are boiled in water (bansh , manti), or deep fried in mutton fat (khuushuur). Other
                     dishes combine the meat with rice or fresh noodles made into various stews (tsuivan , budaatai khuurga) or noodle soups (guriltai shöl).
                    Sülen is a type of hot pot dish.</p>
